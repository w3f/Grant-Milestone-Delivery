## General Notes

See also the team's [post-morten](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/6897) to the endpoints not working on the apps portal.

The actual costs to operate the endpoints especially when listed on the apps portal were much higher than initially budgeted, which was the main reason for the second amendment.
This was partly due to a misconfiguration of the architecure on the team's side and partly due to significantly more traffic flowing through the portal than when the application was initially submitted.
The possibility of an amendment in this regard was highlighted in the application.

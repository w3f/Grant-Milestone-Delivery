| 0a. | License |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK/blob/main/LICENSE) | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [General Documentation](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/24) | Described as "Ongoing progress". Overall, the combination of documentation + draft video tutorials was sufficient for me for this grant evaluation. More extensive/complete documentation and tutorials focused towards users of the upcoming Unity SDK is planned for M3/M4, and will be a great help for user onboarding imo. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Unit-test coverage & Guide](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/25) | Ajuna.SDK auto-generates tests for it's components. The generated tests seem functional, however coverage is a little low (<50% for Ajuna.NetApiExt) using the [Fine Code Coverage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FortuneNgwenya.FineCodeCoverage) tool. Since the code is autogenerated, and everything else seems to work, I'm willing to accept this level of coverage but it could be nice to improve in the future. |
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Article or Tutorial](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/26) | The draft video tutorials are useful, and are a good basis for what's planned for M3/M4. My advice would also be to have a video/article/documentation that gives a bigger overview of Ajuna, and how each of the different parts work and interact with each other - essentially a more detailed explanation of [this graph](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/29#issuecomment-1173754559).  |

A framework for building turn-based board-like games was built (see examples in `ajuna-board` in 2a). |
| 3. | Service Layer |
| 3a. | Service Layer |<ul><li>[x] </li></ul>| [Concept and Artefacts](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Open-Grants-Program/issues/35) | Implemented by [Ajuna.SDK](https://github.com/ajuna-network/Ajuna.SDK), which reads metadata from a websocket endpoint and automatically generates code to allow interfaceing with the node's extrinsics using C# code (see deliverable 7). |

## General Notes

Thanks for this delivery, and the changes & support you've already offered on Matrix. I think the Ajuna.SDK you created as part of this grant is really cool and could also have many uses outside of its application here. 

I do have a few questions about the overall architecture:

1. In my understanding, the Ajuna.SDK generates the following things:
    * C# code to interface with a node and its extrinsics (Ajuna.NetApiExt)
    * A rest api to have endpoints to poll the node's information and subscribe to events
    * Test and mockup code to test the above

Is this correct? If so, what is the relation/difference between NetApiExt, RestClient and RestService? (This information is part of what I'm talking about in `0d` - while it may not be as useful for the end-user on Unity, it'll be helpful for future contributions/development on the Ajuna.SDK itself)

2. For deliverable `3d`, is there some tutorial/example/test that uses it? 

3. The framework for turn-based board-like games is really interesting. Are there plans/ideas for other types of games that might fit?

## General Notes
Thanks for the delivery and the update calls.


## Feedback
Sharing a validator nomination call doesn't work for me. Even though I'm logged in with a multisig member account in another window, it only shows me the signet homepage when following the url. Have you tried this? 

Otherwise all good.

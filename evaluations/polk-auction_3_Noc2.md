## General Notes

They don’t get paid for this milestone, since it’s focused on the deployment. The delivery is according to the contract, but if they continue with it. I strongly recommend to first focus on the usability before adding additional features. For example:
- Website has no favicon
- Very little information on the page itself. 
- Name of projects are missing, etc.

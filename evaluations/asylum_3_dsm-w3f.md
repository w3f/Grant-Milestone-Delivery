## General notes
----
Context

The third milestone covers:
 - upgrade Asylum Unity SDK to work in Unity Play Mode and Standalone build (with the help of substrate client of AjunaSDK);
 - implementation of Unity Editor extension;
 - implementation of a 3D game, which utilizes Asylum features;
 - Creators studio functionality was extended - blueprint patterns added.
-----
## Evaluation V2

### Testing Guide

Unity SDK in standalone mode worked well and Case 3 either.

### Code Quality

#### asylum-item-nft (Rust Node)

Automated tests coverage - ok:

- Asylum Blueprints – lib.rs (87.02%) (+8.40%) - Improved.
- Asylum Off-chain Minter – lib.rs (75.00%) (+75.00%) - Improved.
- Asylum Spaces – lib.rs (87.84%) (+1.26%) - Improved.

Static Analysis (clippy) - ok:


- warning: `pallet-asylum-blueprints` (lib) generated 6 warnings - same as before
- warning: `pallet-asylum-spaces` (lib) generated 49 warnings - same as before.
- warning: `local-runtime` (lib) generated 0 warning - improved
- warning: `asylum-runtime` (lib) generated 0 warning - improved
- warning: `node-asylum` (lib) generated 2 warnings - improved


Documentation - ok:

Now there is more documentation and it is compatible with rustdoc.

Just for notice, this warning was generated by the doc command, maybe could be interesting to solve.
```
warning: public documentation for `command_helper` links to private item `super::command`

   = note: `#[warn(rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links)]` on by default
   = note: the link appears in this line:

   = note: this link will resolve properly if you pass `--document-private-items`

warning: `node-asylum` (lib doc) generated 1 warning
```


#### Asylum-ui (front-end)


Using docker, after running this command `yarn docker:test:up` I got these errors when I opened the web application (creators studio):

```

I also was not able to run the tests since in the browser controlled from cypress there is no Polkadot.js plugin and there are no instructions on how to install it in the tutorial. See the print screen below:

There is no automated test. - They exist but there is a minor problem to run them. 

Eslint report: 94 problems (14 errors, 80 warnings). - Improved

Now - 58 problems (14 errors, 44 warnings)
  3 errors and 0 warnings are potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.

There is no code documentation. Improved, there are some documentation in JSDoc and also Storybook which help to document and see the components of the application.

#### Asylum-unity-sdk (Unity)

There is no automated test. - Improved. There are automated tests. The coverage is about 65%.

![coverage-unity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112647953/195175431-c365f797-a63d-4f0b-a4b0-79607a332f90.jpg)


There are some tests not passing, but this could be because of my machine. The reason for the test fail is a timeout and in my machine, the tests are taking a long time to run.

Some classes don’t have code documentation. - Improved, now some classes have code documentation.


## Evaluation V1


### SDK in Standalone Mode

I'm not a Unity specialist, then some of my doubts and problems here could be for a lack of expertise with this technology. I tried to run the Unit SDK example project and stopped in the error below. In some way should be needed to import the SDK library into the project. As there are no specific instructions for that in the testing guide I stopped in this step. Could you please inform me in more detail how to bypass this problem and continue with the testing?

### Testing Guide

Cases 1 and 2 worked well.

Case 3: Interoperable Items and Drop, I had a problem: 

`yarn seed:demo` – results in the following error (running inside and outside docker container)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112647953/191799459-42b357c6-82fb-4f1f-ac6b-fe5a7d5c4bd8.png)

### Code Quality

#### asylum-item-nft (Rust Node)

Please review and fix the ones that make sense.

| 1.     | Fetch File Implementation       | https://github.com/TDSoftware/substrate-ipfs/blob/milestone-2/frame/tds-ipfs/rpc/src/lib.rs                                                        | Implement the logic that allows clients to fetch a file from IPFS with the Substrate node. E.g. #[prg(name = "nft_getFileById")] will be designed and developed that allows users to redirect a request, which returns Result<String>, to a file server. The PRG mechanism is used to provide a RPC API that can redirect to a file server. The existing IPFS "get file" extrinsic will be obsolet as we provide this new RPC API. |
| 2.     | Web3 Client Extension           | https://github.com/TDSoftware/substrate-ipfs/blob/milestone-1/frame/tds-ipfs/                                                                      | The web3 client will be extend to show the (PRG) redirect feature and retrieve corresponding files via a public IPFS gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 3.     | Local Node Fetch Implementation | https://github.com/TDSoftware/substrate-ipfs/blob/milestone-2/frame/tds-ipfs/rpc/src/lib.rs                                                        | Implement a file fetch RPC API, that returns the file from the local embedded IPFS node instead of the public IPFS gateway. This is helpful when waiting for the file to be available on the public IPFS gateway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

**Additional Information**
We want to continue on developing and applied for another milestone (3) as we discovered potential optimisations during the benchmarking.

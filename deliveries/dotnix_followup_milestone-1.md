**Context** (optional)
With this deliverable, Dotnix provides SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) integration for secure Polkadot validator operations on NixOS.
SELinux is a kernel-level mandatory access control (MAC) system that confines processes and resources to explicitly
defined policies, providing an additional layer of security beyond traditional discretionary access controls.

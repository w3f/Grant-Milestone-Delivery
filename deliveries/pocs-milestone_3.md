**Additional Notes**

 - Since `cargo test` cannot be conducted for our chain extensions, [E2E tests](https://github.com/auguth/pocs/tree/w3f_milestone_3/ink-contracts/e2e_test.sh) for all contracts are conducted. 
 - Tests allowing Root account to call are intentionally avoided and left to fail. Reasons are provided in [Testing & Report](https://github.com/auguth/pocs/blob/w3f_milestone_3/testing-report.md#srctestsrs)

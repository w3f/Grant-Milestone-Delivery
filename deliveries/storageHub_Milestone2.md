# Milestone Delivery :mailbox:

**The delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

* **Application Document:** https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/StorageHub.md 
* **Milestone Number:** 2

**Context** 

StorageHub is a decentralized storage system parachain optimized for file based storage and larger data sets that are not suitable to be stored directly in standard parachain storage. The proposed parachain will provide developers in the Polkadot ecosystem with an alternate decentralized and substrate-based storage solution and functionality.

The two main deliverables for the second milestone are the [article](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/storagehub-looking-ahead/5313) attached below, which represent comprehensive technical design of Storage Hub. And the [proof of concept](https://github.com/Moonsong-Labs/storage-hub-runtime-poc) that illustrate a simplistic execution flow of StorageHub.

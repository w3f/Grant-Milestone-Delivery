| 1a. | Buy me a coffee dApp | [Demo](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/tree/main/ebics-demo) | Convert the old demo to use new stablecoin parachain. Previous functionality is preserved with the addition of receipts available for self-validation. Also, necessary adjustments are made to support XCM minting/burning on Asset Hub. |
| 1b. | Proof-Download | [Proof](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/blob/main/ebics-demo/src/ProofDownload.js) | UI will provide Proof data and instructions, so that anyone can check the proofs offline by themselves, without UI. |
| 2. | Docker-Compose: node & Dapp | [docker compose](https://github.com/element36-io/ocw-ebics/blob/main/docker-compose-test.yml) | We will add the Dapp to the docker-compose file of previous Milestones to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain, the ocw, including a proxy for the FIAT Rest Interface. |

**Additional Information**

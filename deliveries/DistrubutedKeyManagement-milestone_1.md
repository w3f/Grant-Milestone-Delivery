* **Milestone Number:** 1

**Context**

This milestone was focused on distributed key management research. Throughout the research process I created a series of blog posts that discuss core concepts like polynomial interpolation and threshold cryptography. The main deliverable is a long form research paper that has been released as an open source document. I also created a short summary of my research for developers looking to build their own implementation.

**Deliverables**

| 1. | Research Paper |https://www.kryptik.app/blog/wallets| An open source research paper on distributed key management.| 

**Additional Information**

The research process has been a fantastic opportunity to explore and improve wallet security. I have also received a lot of positive feedback from Web3 builders and reserachers. Looking forward to phase two!

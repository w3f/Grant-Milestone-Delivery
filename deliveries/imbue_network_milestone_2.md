**Context** (optional)

Alot of the deliverables on Milestone 2 were actually delivered in Milestone 1. The core flow was complete.

Milestone 2 was about building out a more intuitive UI to allow users to request for funding 

We have shared a demo of the full flow [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dMYNNl76Go)

**Additional Information**
> Because of our overdelivery in milestone 1. This milestone delivery is mostly focused on the UI


During the discussion in our original grant we highlighted the need to build a form of DAO framework, e.g. to allow contributors to give feedback on why they voted

We also want to build out a tendering alternative, to allow more Web2 business to submit briefs and allow the entire network to submit proposals and fund them safely knowing their funds will only be used once they are happy on the progress

This opens up a new market for us and brings in real value and utility that impacts people's lives.

We will be applying for a future grant if the web3 foundation agrees that this adds value to the ecosystem

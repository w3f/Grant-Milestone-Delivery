**Context**

This milestone delivers an improved use interface enabling users to connect Ledger hardware devices and interact with their accounts to facilitate migration from old accounts to the new Polkadot generic app including handling of more complex scenarios. 

Core Features Delivered:

- **Facilitated Migration for accounts with staked assets** : The application facilitates unstaking process, providing users with a simplified flow to unstake their assets and informing them about at what stage theyâ€™re able to initiate the account migration process. The app offers a visual guide for handling common locks tied to standard pallets, assisting users through a manual unlock process when needed.

- **Kusama, AssetHub and 5 Parachain Support**: The app supports all these networks https://docs.zondax.ch/polkadot-migration-app#-supported-networks 

- **People chain support: the app facilitates** specific functionality for People chain operations including: Identity removal workflows, unreserved funds transfer management, chain-specific transaction optimization.

- **Simplified Management of proxies, multisig and decision deposits** : the application supports workflows for managing proxies, multisig accounts and decision deposit reserves, making these processes more user-friendly.

- **Configuration and Documentation**: We are providing a standardized configuration and documentation so compatible parachains can provide parameters, logo and other information to contribute to the current application.

- **Enhanced User Experience**: We have optimicedf lows reducing complexity in multi-step operations and improved error Handling with clear messaging.
